# Laois Arch Club

[Laois Arch Club](https://conal2023.github.io/LaoisArchClub/) is a website for a local organization for adults with intellectual disabilities. The website was set up to help promote such a good organization that I have helped in the past and which a family member is currently still active with their support.

People who visit the page wiLL be able to find out when the next event is, keep up to date via our social links, see the latest photos from recent events, and also contact us.

## Testing

- Device toolbar was also used to see the website through different screen sizes.
- All of the links on the page were tested and confirmed to be responding as they should.
- The contact us form was tested to make sure the fields that required information gave an error, the submit button was tested to confirm it work and also once the submit button was ticked the feedback page responded.

## Bugs

### Solved bugs

- Throughout the project, I had issues where the preview page wouldn't update after I had changed something through CSS even after a hard refresh. The first 2-3 times this happened I found it very frustrating and had to walk away from the PC for a couple of minutes. When I came back Codeanywhere would have signed out and I would have to sign in and open the preview page again. When the page reopened the change would have taken place. After some digging into this through Slack chat I found out this was due to the caches on my browser. Since this whenever a change didn't take effect I would clear the caches first before making sure it wasn't something else.

- Another issue I had was when I put the box around the next event feature. This caused issues with the media feature and would cause the box to pull far to the right away from the rest of the page. This was fixed by changing the units to a percentage rather than a figure. (em, px to %). Once fixed the box appeared correctly under the media request.

### Unsolved bugs

- I am getting a warning regarding my Google Fonts Imports advising me that "Import statements do not load in parallel". Even though I am getting this warning the fonts are still working on the website. Upon investigation through chats with fellow students on Slack, it seems a few students are also having this problem with no one able to find a solution. This will need to be investigated at a later stage.

### Validator Testing

- HTML

  - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.

- CSS

  - No errors were found when passing through the official (jigsaw) validator.

- Accessibility

  - From running through the lighthouse I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible.

## Credits

- The Code Institute Love Running Project had an impact on this project. There may be some similarities in the code but I tried to stray as much as possible away from it.

- The W3Schools.com website helped me a lot when I was struggling to find a way how to do something.

## Media / Content

- The About section and all images were provided by Laois Arch Club for the website. The images would have been taken from their Facebook page which is public and members would have had to opt out of photos taken so no copyrights have been broken.

- The font for the page came from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/).
- The icons used on the page came from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
